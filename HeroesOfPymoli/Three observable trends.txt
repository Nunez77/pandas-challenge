Three observable trends based on the data

1) 84% of players are male; there may be a difference based on gender that causes
males to enjoy more a videogame.

2) The average total purchase per person is higher in females.

3) 45% of players are between 20 and 24 years old.  
This may have to do in part with the population curve of high consuming countries, 
but there is probably another more significant explanation, like for example, purchasing power.  
The amount of money available for games may be higher when a person finishes school and still does not have
responsabilities.
